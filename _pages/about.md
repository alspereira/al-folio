**Industrial kitchens (IKs)** use between 5 and 7 times more energy per square meter than other commercial building spaces like office buildings and retail stores [[1](https://google.com)]. Furthermore, studies indicate that in the EU, UK, and the US, **30% of the energy consumed in industrial kitchens is used in purely commercial establishments**, e.g., restaurants and snack-bars [[2]()].

Despite the size and ubiquity of this industry, **the role of IKs in the global quest for sustainable energy systems is still widely under-explored**.

The **nexIK** project will address this important topic, **proposing a new methodology to quantify the interactions between Water, Energy and Food in IKs**. Commonly known as the Water-Energy-Food Nexus (WEFN), the developed methodology will provide a holistic approach to **assess the impact of IK activity on the consumption of electricity and water**.

This project builds upon ongoing research in two associate laboratories from Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology [(FCT)](https://www.fct.pt/), namely [LARSyS](https://www.larsys.pt) and [INESC-ID](https://www.inesc-id.pt/) both of which have a strong focus on sustainable energy systems and distributed energy resources management research.

The **nexIK** project (EXPL/CCI-COM/1234/2021) is funded by the FCP, I.P. /MCTES through national funds (PIDDAC).


<strong style="color:#014f82"> Participate in the nexIK project by providing information about your Commercial / Industrial Kitchen. You can do that by filling out this survey: <a href="http://shorturl.at/hPZ49" target="_blank">http://shorturl.at/hPZ49</a><strong>
