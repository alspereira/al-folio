To achieve the project objectives, several research activities will be carried out. Such activities will be developed in the scope of five main tasks. T1: UUser-Centered Research; T2: Resource Monitoring; T3: Data-Driven Nexus Modeling; T4: Demand Side Flexibility and Energy Efficiency; and T5: Abstraction and Scale-up.

## T1: User-Centered Research

This task will focus on understanding the perceptions of the main IKs stakeholders concerning the WEFN, and energy efficiency/flexibility opportunities to evaluate the role of behavior in successful implementations of sustainable solutions. The User Research approach will be applied tomachive the goals of this task.

## T2: Resource Monitoring

This task includes all the activities related to the deployment and maintenance of the year-long data collection campaign in two IKs that will be recruited basedd on the results from T1. More precisely, electricity (including individual appliances) and water consumption will be monitored.

## T3: Data-Driven Nexus Modeling

This task will focus on developing and evaluating data-driven methods to model the Water-Energy-Food Nexus in the two IKs. This will be done using the qualitative data collected in T1 and the electricity and water consumption measurements from the data collection campaign in T2.

## T4: Demand Side Flexibility and Energy Efficiency

This task includes all the activities related to exploring the potential for increasing the energy efficiency of IKs as well as their ability to provide flexibility to system operators. Likewise, this task will also explore the role of Renewable Energy Systems (RES) and storage devices in IKs.

## T5: Abstraction and Scale-up

This task will focus on leveraging the results from the previous taks to develop abstract models of IKs that can be used to generalize the nexIK result across different types of IKs. Likewise, this tasks also aims at identifying additional funding opportunities.
