  description: Lucas Pereira received his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Madeira, Portugal, in 2016. 
              Since then, he is at ITI/LARSyS, where he leads the Further Energy and Environment research Laboratory (FEELab). 
              Since 2019 he is an Assistant Researcher at Instituto Superior Técnico (IST).
              
              Lucas’s research applies data science, machine learning, and human-computer interaction techniques
              to structured and unstructured data streams to address real-world problems focusing on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
              His current research focuses on future energy systems, and sustainable built environments (SDGs 7, 11, 12, 13), and 
              typically involves the real-world deployment and evaluation of non-intrusive monitoring technologies and intelligent software systems.
