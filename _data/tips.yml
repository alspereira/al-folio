  brief: Tip Brief Description
  description: Fluorescent Tubular Bulbs are describer as having a superior energy efficiency in comparison to Incandescent Bulbs, consuming up to 80%
              less electricity. Fluorescent Lights have a lifespan between 10.000 and 20.000 hours and are frequently used in kitchens.

              LED (Light Emitting Diode) is, at the moment in technology, the most efficient and displays higher levels of durability.
              Managing savings up to 90% of energy in contrast with Incandescent Bulbs, even though LEDs are costly their lifespan is between
              40.000 and 80.000 hours. LED tech doesn't require toxics in their composition being free of mercury.



              To maximize savings in the illumination sector is suggested the replacement of T8 lights to 'GreenTubes Eco-Balastro' lights easily allowing any lighting
              system update to new T5 efficient lights. It is also recommended to replace any Incandescent lamps for LEDs.

              There are measures that can be taken in order to take advantage of the natural illumination, using lighter colors on the walls maximizing the existing
              illumination, adapting the light levels according to the activities, avoiding the usage of Incandescent Bulbs, opting for Fluorescent, 'Eco-Balastro' and
              LED lights is always possible.

  brief: Tip Brief Description
  description: Reducing the drying time to the minimum, or turning off the dishwasher after the rinsing and opening the door,
              enabling the dishes to dry without wasting energy, is a step that can save between 30% and 50% energy of a full washing
              cycle.

              Dishwashers are the biggest consumer in the appliances sector, is recommended to connect the machine to the AQS grid
              making it save significant energy.
